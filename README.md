## tcp-chat-room  

* Description:
For this project I'm  implementing a TCP server using the `net` module. Working with node.js EventEmitter's.

* How to get the project running:
 To get this project running you will need to install the dependencies listed in the package.json.

* How to connect to the server:

To connect to the server you'll need at least three terminal windows open. You'll use one as the server and the other two windows are running off that server. These two windows are acting as the two people chatting back and forth.

But first, for the server terminal window you will navigate into your project, specifically the folder that houses the server.js file. Then you'll run 'node server.js' which will start nodemon and "you're off to the races."
Then for the other two "chat" windows you will type 'npm install uuid' to get a universally unique identifier package installed. To establish a TCP connection you will type 'nc localhost 3000.'
